## Project Description

The purpose of the project was to build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API. When the user searches a city by name, the app will display the name of the searched city both in a search history box and on the main screen. On the main screen the city's weather stats will show up for the current day, as well as abbreviated stats for the next five days.

I plan to come back to this project to finish it. On my local machine I was able to get the API fetch to work, meaning I could search cities and generate daily weather stats accordingly, but when testing the URL via GitHub it seemed like my app no longer ran correctly.
